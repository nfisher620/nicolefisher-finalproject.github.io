				Look no further!</h2>

				<p>
					Hi! Welcome to Disneyland Secrets Revealed! My name is Nicole and I am a HUGE Disneyland lover. Ever since my first trip to Disneyland when I was 4 years old, I call this place my second home. As a tradition, my family and I would go to Disneyland every New Year's Day. We've kept this tradition going for almost 25 years now. Being an annual pass holder for more than 10 years now has allowed me to learn a couple of secrets of this magical place. From when the best times to go on rides to hidden menu food items, you'll learn it all from my experiences. I hope you find one tip useful on your next trip to Disneyland whether you are first-time visitor, on vacation, or an annual pass holder like myself.
