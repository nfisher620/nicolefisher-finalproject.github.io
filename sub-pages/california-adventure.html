			<h3>Rides</h3>
			
				<p>
					If you think Disneyland has good rides, check out the rides at Disney California Adventure. From thrill rides to classic Disney movie rides, they have it all. Here's my top 5 favorite rides that you must go on if you visit DCA (as annual passholders like to call it):
				</p>
	
				<ul>
					<li>Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout - I am Groot</li>
					<li>Radiator Spring Racers - race against your component for the ultimate prize of the Winston Cup!</li>
					<li>The Little Mermaid - I want to be part of that world</li>
					<li>Incredicoaster - queue the Incredibles theme song</li>
					<li>Soarin - see all of the beautiful places across the world..for free!</li>
				</ul>
			
			<h3>Food</h3>
			
				<p>
					One of my husband and I's favorite things to do is deciding where we will eat in California Adventure. One day we will like Lobster Nachos, the other day we want something a little more fancier like Carthay Circle. Here's a list of the top speciality food and their locations:
				</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Lobster Nachos at the Lamplight Lounge</li>
					<li>Jack Jack Num Num Cookie near the Incredicoaster</li>
					<li>Santa Rosa Corn Chowder at Boudin Bakery</li>
				</ul>
			
			<h3>Shows</h3>
			
				<p>
					Disneyland has competition when it comes to entertainment. My husband and I often find ourselves wanting to watch shows in California Adventure over Disneyland - yes really. Here are the must shows you need to see:
				</p>
	
				<ul>
					<li>Frozen the Musical - the cold didn't bother me anyway</li>
					<li>Paint the Night Parade - when can we do this again?</li>
					<li>World of Color - who knew that colors and water would work so great together</li>
				</ul>
