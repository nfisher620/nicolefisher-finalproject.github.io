			<h3>Which One Do I Buy?</h3>

				<p>
					One of my favorite traditions growing up was at the end of very Disneyland trip, my grandparents would let me and my sister pick out souvenir. The normal go to was a stuffed animal of Chip and Dale as they are my favorite Disney characters. As I got older and realized that I had enough Chip and Dale stuffed animals, I wanted to add settle hints of Disney in my home. Here's a list of my 3 favorite Disney themed souvenirs that you can only get at Disneyland:
				</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Personalized Mickey hat at the Mad Hatter</li>
					<li>Disneyland spirit tee - they have a large assortment to choose from!</li>
					<li>Disney character coffee mug - my favorite is Baymax</li>
				</ul>
			
			<h3>Where Did You Get That?</h3>
			
				<p>
					Now you know what to buy but do you know where to get them? What's great about Disneyland is that they have so many specialty stores but it can overwhelming on knowing where to get what. Here's a breakdown of my favorite specialty shops:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique - where you can transform into your favorite Disney princess</li>
					<li>Emporium - this store is located at the end of Main Street. If you need a last minute souvenir, this is the place to go.</li>
					<li>Little Green Men Store Command - everything Toy Story. To an infinity and beyond!</li>
					<li>Star Trader - everything and anything Star Wars. May the force be with you.</li>
				</ul>
