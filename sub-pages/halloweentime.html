			<h3>Food</h3>

				<p>
					One of the best things about Halloween Time at Disneyland is the food of course! My husband and I often go during this time just to grab some Mickey Pumpkin Spice Beignets at the Mint Julep Bar. If you're visiting during September and/or October, try at least one item as these food items are only available during this time. Here is a list of the treats that are a must try:
				</p>

				<ul>	
					<li>Orange Sugar Churro with Candy Corn Sauce near Big Thunder Mountain</li>
					<li>Pumpkin Spice Churro with Cream Cheese Frosting near Haunted Mansion</li>
					<li>Churro Bites Cereal Sundae with fruit cereal-dusted churros, cereal milk anglaise, strawberry ice cream, and raspberry sauce at the Hungry Bear Restaurant</li>
					<li>Churro Sundae with cookie butter gelato at the Golden Horesehoe</li>
					<li>Maleficent Churro covered with chocolate cookie crumbles blended with colored sugar near Sleeping Beauty's Castle</li>
					<li>Sour Apple Churro near Astro Blasters in Tomorrowland</li>
					<li>Frozen Abuelita Horchata at Caf√© Orleans</li>
					<li>Crab & Corn Chowder at the French Market</li>
					<li>Black Rose Dessert at Troubadour Tavern</li>
					<li>Pumpkin Spice Mickey Beignets at the Bengal Barbecue</li>	
					<li>Halloween-Themed Dessert Trio at the Mint Julep Bar</li>
				</ul>


			<h3>Rides</h3>
				
				<p>
					Don't forget about the rides! Disneyland does a great job transforming your favorite rides just for Halloween. Here are the spookiest rides you'll find:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy - don't get scared</li>	
					<li>Haunted Mansion Holiday - say hello to the pumpkin king himself</li>
				</ul>
	
			<h3>Souvenirs</h3>

				<p>
					Looking to add to your Halloween decor? Look no further! From Mickey pumpkin votives to Minnie Halloween ears, Disneyland has it all. Every year they change their design, so if you see something you like get it as it will look different the following year! Check these out next time you go:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Minnie Halloween ears - orange and black never looked so good</li>
					<li>Mickey Mouse Pumpkin Votive - great to put a candle inside</li>
					<li>Mickey Mouse Spirit tee - boo to you!</li>
					<li>Mickey and friends candy cauldron - trick or treat</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Entertainment</h3>
				
				<p>
					I put a spell on you and now your mine. Who wouldn't want to see Mickey and his friends get all dressed up in their Halloween costumes. One of the best parties that only happens during Hallloween time is Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party. You'll need to buy a separate ticket for this event but it's worth it. Kids can trick or treat around the park, meet all of their favorite Disney villians, and watch a ghouling firework show. If you're thinking about going, do it. You won't regret it.
